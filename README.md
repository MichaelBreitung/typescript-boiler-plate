# Coworker Module Template

This template creates a basic Typescript library project.
To create a project:

1) Install Python on your system if you don't have it already.
2) Install [Cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/): `pip3 install cookiecutter`.
3) Create the project: `cookiecutter https://github.com/MichaelBreitung/typescript-boiler-plate.git`
4) When asked for a project name, provide one. Ideally, use a single word.
5) Next you'll be asked for the "project_slug". This will be used as folder name for the project and as name for the library.
6) You can also select if you want only a ESM, a CJS, or a IIFE module. Or you can select to create "all".

A new folder with the project will be created under "project_slug".
Git will already be initialized.
